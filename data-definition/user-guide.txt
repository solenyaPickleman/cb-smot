1. Data Description
This GPS trajectory dataset was collected in (Microsoft Research Asia) Geolife project by 182 users in a period of over five years
(from April 2007 to August 2012). A GPS trajectory of this dataset is represented by a sequence of time-stamped points, each of
which contains the information of latitude, longitude and altitude. This dataset contains 17,621 trajectories with a total distance of
1,292,951kilometers and a total duration of 50,176 hours. These trajectories were recorded by different GPS loggers and GPSphones, and have a variety of sampling rates. 91.5 percent of the trajectories are logged in a dense representation, e.g. every 1~5
seconds or every 5~10 meters per point.
This dataset recoded a broad range of users’ outdoor movements, including not only life routines like go home and go to work
but also some entertainments and sports activities, such as shopping, sightseeing, dining, hiking, and cycling. This trajectory
dataset can be used in many research fields, such as mobility pattern mining, user activity recognition, location-based social
networks, location privacy, and location recommendation.
Although this dataset is wildly distributed in over 30 cities of China and even in some cities located in the USA and Europe,
the majority of the data was created in Beijing, China. Figure 1 plots the distribution (heat map) of this dataset in Beijing. The
figures standing on the right side of the heat bar denote the number of points generated in a location.

The distributions of distance and duration of the trajectories are presented in Figure 2 and Figure 3.
In the data collection program, a portion of users have carried a GPS logger for years, while some of the others only have a
trajectory dataset of a few weeks. This distribution is presented in Figure 4, and the distribution of the number of trajectories
collected by each user is shown in Figure 5.

2. What’s new?
2.1. Transportation mode labels
73 users have labeled their trajectories with transportation mode, such as driving, taking a bus, riding a bike and walking. There
is a label file storing the transportation mode labels in each user’s folder. See section 4.2 for the format of labels.
The total distance and duration of transportation modes are listed in Figure 6. Though this only covers a part of the dataset used
in the following papers, the scale of this released dataset can still support transportation mode learning.

4. Data Format
4.1. Trajectory file
Every single folder of this dataset stores a user’s GPS log files, which were converted to PLT format. Each PLT file contains a
single trajectory and is named by its starting time. To avoid potential confusion of time zone, we use GMT in the date/time
property of each point, which is different from our previous release.
PLT format:
Line 1…6 are useless in this dataset, and can be ignored. Points are described in following lines, one for each line.
Field 1: Latitude in decimal degrees.
Field 2: Longitude in decimal degrees.
Field 3: All set to 0 for this dataset.
Field 4: Altitude in feet (-777 if not valid).
Field 5: Date - number of days (with fractional part) that have passed since 12/30/1899.
Field 6: Date as a string.
Field 7: Time as a string.
Note that field 5 and field 6&7 represent the same date/time in this dataset. You may use either of them.

Example:
39.906631,116.385564,0,492,40097.5864583333,2009-10-11,14:04:30
39.906554,116.385625,0,492,40097.5865162037,2009-10-11,14:04:35

4.2. Transportation mode labels
Possible transportation modes are: walk, bike, bus, car, subway, train, airplane, boat, run and motorcycle. Again, we have
converted the date/time of all labels to GMT, even though most of them were created in China.
Example:
Start Time

End Time Transportation Mode

bus

2008/04/03 01:07:03

2008/04/03 11:55:07

car

First, you can regard the label of both taxi and car as driving although we set them with different labels for future usage. Second, a
user could label the transportation mode of a light rail as train while others may use subway as the label. Actually, no trajectory
can be recorded in an underground subway system since a GPS logger cannot receive any signal there. In Beijing, the light rails
and subway systems are seamlessly connected, e.g., line 13 (a light rail) is connected with line 10 and line 2, which are subway
systems. Sometimes, a line (like line 5) is comprised of partial subways and partial light rails. So, users may have a variety of
understanding in their transportation modes. You can differentiate the real train trajectories (connecting two cities) from the light
rail trajectory (generating in a city) according to their distances. Or, just treat them the same.
